# Employee Management System

Welcome to the Employee Management System! This C# console program demonstrates basic employee management using a stack and list.

## Employee Class

The `Employee` class represents an employee with the following attributes:

- `Id`: Employee ID
- `Name`: Employee name
- `Gender`: Employee gender
- `Salary`: Employee salary

## Program Class

The `Program` class contains the main logic of the Employee Management System. It does the following:

1. Creates a stack (`employeeInfo`) to store employee information.
2. Initializes instances of the `Employee` class and adds them to the stack.
3. Demonstrates retrieving and displaying employee information using the `foreach` loop.
4. Utilizes the `Pop` method to retrieve and display employee information.
5. Uses the `Peek` method to retrieve and display employee information without removing them from the stack.
6. Checks if a specific employee is present in the stack.
7. Creates a list (`employeeList`) and performs various operations, such as checking if an employee exists, finding the first male employee, and finding all male employees.

Feel free to explore the program and make modifications as needed. This serves as a simple example of employee management using C#.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution in a C# development environment.
3. Run the program (`Program.cs`).
